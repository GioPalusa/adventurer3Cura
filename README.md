# Cura settings for Flashforge Adventurer 3

Installation Instructions

Install Cura and launch it. Cura will prompt you to add a printer. Pick any one, the default is fine.

Add the X3GWriter plugin from the Marketplace menu item. Quit Cura.

Find the location of the Cura configuration folder. This is dependant on your operating system, and for Cura 4.4.x it should be:
- Linux: ~/.local/share/cura/4.4
- MacOS: ~/Library/Application Support/cura/4.4
- Windows: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\cura\4.4

The files must be extracted/added into the same folder names (definitions & extruders) as they are located here.

Launch Cura and add the printer(s) by selecting from the menu "Preferences ==> Configure Cura... ==> Printers ==> Add ==> Add a non-networked printer" - scroll down to "Flashforge" and expand it.

Happy slicing!
